The square-list operation essentially places elements onto an access stack such 
that elements that come earlier are accessed in the list later. 
For a given list l, a given element x_i before in l and an x_j preceding x_i in l, 
square(x_j) will always be added before square(x_i). Due to the access-stack like nature of the 
generated list, square(x_j) will then always be accessed after square(x_i).


In the second example, nil would be placed first. Once the interpreter accesses the nil element,
it perceives the list as completed. This would result in a perceived empty list.
