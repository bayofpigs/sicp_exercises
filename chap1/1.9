First procedure
===============
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

This is a recursive process. It demonstrates a growing then a shrinking process evolution 
cooresponding with expansion on process evaluation.

Second Procedure
================
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9

This is an iterative process. Each state can be summarized by a fixed number of state 
variables.
